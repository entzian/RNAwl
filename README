## Estimate the Density of Satates via Wang-Landau sampling


### CAVEATS: 

Histograms are allocated to uniformly cover the sampling range per
default. If you would like to have more fine-grained control over the
histogram layout, you can provide a custom bin width via the --resolution
option. The sampling range will then be computed as <resolution> * <bins>,
i.e. the upper bound of the sampling range is then computed as <mfe> +
<resolution> * <bins>.
