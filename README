# RNAwl - Sample Density of Satates via Wang-Landau sampling

The Wang-Landau algorithm [1,2] is a Mote Carlo approach for sampling the
Density of States (DOS) of a system via a random walk in energy space. It
has been successfully applied to classical systems like the Ising model or
spin glasses.

This as an implementation of the Wang-Landau algorithm for RNA secondary
structures. RNA-related computation is performed by libRNA (available with
the ViennaRNA Package [3]).

### Usage

A typical command line for running a simulation with 1000 bins and a fixed
bin width of 0.1 (kcal/mol) is

./RNAwl --bins 1000 --resolution 0.1 myrna.in

RNAwl expects a single input file containg the nucleotide sequence and a
start structure in dot-backet notation on separate lines. e.g.:
CGGCGACUGCCGUAUGAAUCUCUAUGAGCG
((((....)))).......(((...)))..

./RNAwl -h lists available options and --info gives default values for all
parameters.

TODO: OUTPUT


### Evaluation of results

To evaluate convergence, we have included a helper script that computes the
relative error of the sampled DOS vs a 'reference' DOS. eval_sampledDOS.pl
is available in the Perl/ folder of the distribution

### Dependencies

* libgsl [GNU Scientific Library]
* libRNA >=2.2 [ViennaRNA Library] 
  ( available at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/index.html)

### Caveats

Histograms are allocated to uniformly cover the sampling range per
default. If you would like to have more fine-grained control over the
histogram layout, you can provide a custom bin width via the --resolution
option. The sampling range will then be computed as <resolution> * <bins>,
i.e. the upper bound of the sampling range is then computed as <mfe> +
<resolution> * <bins>.
